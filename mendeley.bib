  author   = "Herculano-Houzel, Suzana",
  abstract = "The human brain has often been viewed as outstanding among
              mammalian brains: the most cognitively able, the
              largest-than-expected from body size, endowed with an
              overdeveloped cerebral cortex that represents over 80\% of brain
              mass, and purportedly containing 100 billion neurons and 10x more
              glial cells. Such uniqueness was seemingly necessary to justify
              the superior cognitive abilities of humans over larger-brained
              mammals such as elephants and whales. However, our recent studies
              using a novel method to determine the cellular composition of the
              brain of humans and other primates as well as of rodents and
              insectivores show that, since different cellular scaling rules
              apply to the brains within these orders, brain size can no longer
              be considered a proxy for the number of neurons in the brain.
              These studies also showed that the human brain is not exceptional
              in its cellular composition, as it was found to contain as many
              neuronal and non-neuronal cells as would be expected of a primate
              brain of its size. Additionally, the so-called overdeveloped
              human cerebral cortex holds only 19\% of all brain neurons, a
              fraction that is similar to that found in other mammals. In what
              regards absolute numbers of neurons, however, the human brain
              does have two advantages compared to other mammalian brains:
              compared to rodents, and probably to whales and elephants as
              well, it is built according to the very economical, space-saving
              scaling rules that apply to other primates; and, among
              economically built primate brains, it is the largest, hence
              containing the most neurons. These findings argue in favor of a
              view of cognitive abilities that is centered on absolute numbers
              of neurons, rather than on body size or encephalization, and call
              for a re-examination of several concepts related to the
              exceptionality of the human brain.",

               whose work the field rests. This is accompanied by a discussion
               of both the theories and experiments which were contributed to
               the development of the field. The physiological origin of
               bioelectric and biomagnetic signal is discussed in detail. The
               sensitivity in a given measurement situation, the energy
               distribution in stimulation with the same electrodes, and the
               measurement of impedance are related and described by the
               electrode lead field. It is shown that, based on the reciprocity
               theorem, these are identical and further, that these procedures
               apply equally well for biomagnetic considerations. The
               difference between corresponding bioelectric and biomagnetic
               methods is discussed. The book shows, that all subfields of
               bioelectromagnetism obey the same basic laws and they are
               closely tied together through the principle of reciprocity. Thus
               the book helps the reader to understand the properties of
               existing bioelectric and biomagnetic measurements and
               stimulation methods and to design new systems. The book includes

               according to their key characteristics within HCI scenarios.
               This comprises classical approaches, which we group into active
               and reactive BCIs, and the new group of passive BCIs. Passive
               BCIs provide easily applicable and yet efficient interaction
               channels carrying information on covert aspects of user state,
               while adding little further usage cost. All of these systems can
               also be set up as hybrid BCIs, by incorporating information from
               outside the brain to make predictions, allowing for enhanced
               robustness over conventional approaches. With these properties,
               passive and hybrid BCIs are particularly useful in HCI. When any
               BCI is transferred from the laboratory to real-world situations,
               one faces new types of problems resulting from uncontrolled
               environmental factors---mostly leading to artifacts
               contaminating data and results. The handling of these situations
               is treated in a brief review of training and calibration
               strategies. The presented theory is then underpinned by two
               concrete examples. First, a combination of Event Related
               Desynchronization (ERD)-based active BCI with gaze control,
               defining a hybrid BCI as solution for the midas touch problem.
               And second, a passive BCI based on human error processing,
               leading to new forms of automated adaptation in HCI. This is in
               line with the results from other recent studies of passive BCI
               technology and shows the broad potential of this approach.",

              multiple neocortical areas. Fast Fourier transforms, auto- and

              used to determine the frequency and temporal coherence of fast
              oscillations that outlasted the stimulation of ascending
              activating systems or that occurred naturally during behavioral
              states of waking and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep but also
              appeared during the depolarizing phases of slow sleep
              oscillations. In 90\% of microelectrode tracks, the fast
              oscillations did not show field reversal at any depth of the
              cortex and were not observable in the underlying white matter.
              The negative field potentials of the fast oscillations were
              associated at all depths with neuronal firing. This field
              potential property of fast oscillations was in sharp contrast to
              the reversal of slow sleep oscillation or evoked potentials at
              depths of 0.25-0.5 mm. The coherence of fast spontaneous rhythms
              was spatially limited, being confined within a cortical column
              and among closely located neocortical sites, in contrast to the
              long-range synchronization of slow sleep rhythms. Depolarizing
              current pulses elicited spike-bursts (200-400 Hz) recurring at a
              frequency of 30-40 Hz. Our experiments demonstrate that the
              conventional notion of a totally desynchronized cortical activity
              upon arousal should be revised as fast rhythms are enhanced and
              synchronized within intracortical networks during brain
              activation. Spontaneously occurring, subthreshold membrane
              potential depolarizing oscillations may bias cortical and
              thalamic neurons to respond synchronously, at fast frequencies,
              to relevant stimuli in the wake state or to internally generated

  abstract = "A brain-computer interface (BCI) enables communication without
              movement based on brain signals measured with
              electroencephalography (EEG). BCIs usually rely on one of three
              types of signals: the P300 and other components of the
              event-related potential (ERP), steady state visual evoked
              potential (SSVEP), or event related desynchronization (ERD).
              Although P300 BCIs were introduced over twenty years ago, the
              past few years have seen a strong increase in P300 BCI research.
              This closed-loop BCI approach relies on the P300 and other
              components of the ERP, based on an oddball paradigm presented to
              the subject. In this paper, we overview the current status of
              P300 BCI technology, and then discuss new directions: paradigms
              for eliciting P300s; signal processing methods; applications; and
              hybrid BCIs. We conclude that P300 BCIs are quite promising, as
              several emerging directions have not yet been fully explored and
              could lead to improvements in bit rate, reliability, usability,
              and flexibility.",

                   in making human-computer interaction more natural,
                   especially for people with neuro-muscular disabilities.
                   Among the existing solutions the systems relying on
                   electroencephalograms (EEG) occupy the most prominent place
                   due to their non-invasiveness. However, the process of
                   translating EEG signals into computer commands is far from
                   trivial, since it requires the optimization of many
                   different parameters that need to be tuned jointly. In this
                   report, we focus on the category of EEG-based BCIs that rely
                   on Steady-State-Visual-Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) and
                   perform a comparative evaluation of the most promising
                   algorithms existing in the literature. More specifically, we
                   define a set of algorithms for each of the various different
                   parameters composing a BCI system (i.e. filtering, artifact
                   removal, feature extraction, feature selection and
                   classification) and study each parameter independently by
                   keeping all other parameters fixed. The results obtained
                   from this evaluation process are provided together with a
                   dataset consisting of the 256-channel, EEG signals of 11
                   subjects, as well as a processing toolbox for reproducing
                   the results and supporting further experimentation. In this
                   way, we manage to make available for the community a
                   state-of-the-art baseline for SSVEP-based BCIs that can be
                   used as a basis for introducing novel methods and
                   approaches.",
