  abstract = "Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) has been widely used in the
              detection of the steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs)
              in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). The standard CCA method,
              which uses sinusoidal signals as reference signals, was first
              proposed for SSVEP detection without calibration. However, the
              detection performance can be deteriorated by the interference
              from the spontaneous EEG activities. Recently, various extended
              methods have been developed to incorporate individual EEG
              calibration data in CCA to improve the detection performance.
              Although advantages of the extended CCA methods have been
              demonstrated in separate studies, a comprehensive comparison
              between these methods is still missing. This study performed a
              comparison of the existing CCA-based SSVEP detection methods
              using a 12-class SSVEP dataset recorded from 10 subjects in a
              simulated online BCI experiment. Classification accuracy and
              information transfer rate (ITR) were used for performance
              evaluation. The results suggest that individual calibration data
              can significantly improve the detection performance. Furthermore,
              the results showed that the combination method based on the
              standard CCA and the individual template based CCA (IT-CCA)
              achieved the highest performance.",

                   Among the existing solutions the systems relying on
                   electroencephalograms (EEG) occupy the most prominent place
                   due to their non-invasiveness. However, the process of
                   translating EEG signals into computer commands is far from
                   trivial, since it requires the optimization of many
                   different parameters that need to be tuned jointly. In this

               BCI is based on the Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential

  abstract = "Introduction The main idea of a traditional Steady State Visually
              Evoked Potentials (SSVEP)-BCI is the activation of commands
              through gaze control. For this purpose, the retina of the eye is
              excited by a stimulus at a certain frequency. Several studies
              have shown effects related to different kind of stimuli,
              frequencies, window lengths, techniques of feature extraction and
              even classification. So far, none of the previous studies has
              performed a comparison of performance of stimuli colors through
              LED technology. This study addresses precisely this important
              aspect and would be a great contribution to the topic of
              SSVEP-BCIs. Additionally, the performance of different colors at
              different frequencies and the visual comfort were evaluated in
              each case. Methods LEDs of four different colors (red, green,
              blue and yellow) flickering at four distinct frequencies (8, 11,
              13 and 15 Hz) were used. Twenty subjects were distributed in two
              groups performing different protocols. Multivariate
              Synchronization Index (MSI) was the technique adopted as feature
              extractor. Results The accuracy was gradually enhanced with the
              increase of the time window. From our observations, the red color
              provides, in most frequencies, both highest rates of accuracy and
              Information Transfer Rate (ITR) for detection of SSVEP.
              Conclusion Although the red color has presented higher ITR, this
              color was turned in the less comfortable one and can even elicit
              epileptic responses according to the literature. For this reason,
              the green color is suggested as the best choice according to the
              proposed rules. In addition, this color has shown to be safe and
              accurate for an SSVEP-BCI.",

               electric fields in living tissue and for using hard science to
               study human consciousness and cognition. No comparable volume
               exists for it is no easy task to explain the problems of EEG in
               clear language, with mathematics presented mainly in appendices.
               Among the many topics covered by the Second Edition are micro
               and meso (intermediate scale) synaptic sources, electrode
               placement, choice of reference, volume conduction, power and
               coherence measures, projection of scalp potentials to dura
               surface, dynamic signatures of conscious experience, neural
               networks immersed in global fields of synaptic action, and
               physiological bases for brain source dynamics. The Second
               Edition is an invaluable resource for neurologists,
               neuroscientists (especially cognitive neuroscientists),
               biomedical engineers, and their students and trainees. It will
               also appeal to physicists, mathematicians, computer scientists,
               psychiatrists, and industrial engineers interested in EEG.",

@ARTICLE{Herculano-Houzel2009-vm,
  title    = "The human brain in numbers: a linearly scaled-up primate brain",
  author   = "Herculano-Houzel, Suzana",
  abstract = "The human brain has often been viewed as outstanding among
              mammalian brains: the most cognitively able, the
              largest-than-expected from body size, endowed with an
              overdeveloped cerebral cortex that represents over 80\% of brain
              mass, and purportedly containing 100 billion neurons and 10x more
              glial cells. Such uniqueness was seemingly necessary to justify
              the superior cognitive abilities of humans over larger-brained
              mammals such as elephants and whales. However, our recent studies
              using a novel method to determine the cellular composition of the
              brain of humans and other primates as well as of rodents and
              insectivores show that, since different cellular scaling rules
              apply to the brains within these orders, brain size can no longer
              be considered a proxy for the number of neurons in the brain.
              These studies also showed that the human brain is not exceptional
              in its cellular composition, as it was found to contain as many
              neuronal and non-neuronal cells as would be expected of a primate
              brain of its size. Additionally, the so-called overdeveloped
              human cerebral cortex holds only 19\% of all brain neurons, a
              fraction that is similar to that found in other mammals. In what
              regards absolute numbers of neurons, however, the human brain
              does have two advantages compared to other mammalian brains:
              compared to rodents, and probably to whales and elephants as
              well, it is built according to the very economical, space-saving
              scaling rules that apply to other primates; and, among
              economically built primate brains, it is the largest, hence
              containing the most neurons. These findings argue in favor of a
              view of cognitive abilities that is centered on absolute numbers
              of neurons, rather than on body size or encephalization, and call
              for a re-examination of several concepts related to the
              exceptionality of the human brain.",

               historical account of the many innovations and innovators on
               whose work the field rests. This is accompanied by a discussion
               of both the theories and experiments which were contributed to
               the development of the field. The physiological origin of
               bioelectric and biomagnetic signal is discussed in detail. The
               sensitivity in a given measurement situation, the energy
               distribution in stimulation with the same electrodes, and the
               measurement of impedance are related and described by the
               electrode lead field. It is shown that, based on the reciprocity
               theorem, these are identical and further, that these procedures
               apply equally well for biomagnetic considerations. The
               difference between corresponding bioelectric and biomagnetic
               methods is discussed. The book shows, that all subfields of
               bioelectromagnetism obey the same basic laws and they are
               closely tied together through the principle of reciprocity. Thus
               the book helps the reader to understand the properties of
               existing bioelectric and biomagnetic measurements and

               according to their key characteristics within HCI scenarios.
               This comprises classical approaches, which we group into active
               and reactive BCIs, and the new group of passive BCIs. Passive
               BCIs provide easily applicable and yet efficient interaction
               channels carrying information on covert aspects of user state,
               while adding little further usage cost. All of these systems can
               also be set up as hybrid BCIs, by incorporating information from
               outside the brain to make predictions, allowing for enhanced
               robustness over conventional approaches. With these properties,
               passive and hybrid BCIs are particularly useful in HCI. When any
               BCI is transferred from the laboratory to real-world situations,
               one faces new types of problems resulting from uncontrolled
               environmental factors---mostly leading to artifacts
               contaminating data and results. The handling of these situations
               is treated in a brief review of training and calibration
               strategies. The presented theory is then underpinned by two
               concrete examples. First, a combination of Event Related
               Desynchronization (ERD)-based active BCI with gaze control,
               defining a hybrid BCI as solution for the midas touch problem.
               And second, a passive BCI based on human error processing,
               leading to new forms of automated adaptation in HCI. This is in
               line with the results from other recent studies of passive BCI
               technology and shows the broad potential of this approach.",

              multiple neocortical areas. Fast Fourier transforms, auto- and
              cross-correlations, and spike- or wave-triggered averages were
              used to determine the frequency and temporal coherence of fast
              oscillations that outlasted the stimulation of ascending
              activating systems or that occurred naturally during behavioral
              states of waking and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep but also
              appeared during the depolarizing phases of slow sleep
              oscillations. In 90\% of microelectrode tracks, the fast
              oscillations did not show field reversal at any depth of the
              cortex and were not observable in the underlying white matter.
              The negative field potentials of the fast oscillations were
              associated at all depths with neuronal firing. This field
              potential property of fast oscillations was in sharp contrast to
              the reversal of slow sleep oscillation or evoked potentials at
              depths of 0.25-0.5 mm. The coherence of fast spontaneous rhythms
              was spatially limited, being confined within a cortical column
              and among closely located neocortical sites, in contrast to the
              long-range synchronization of slow sleep rhythms. Depolarizing
              current pulses elicited spike-bursts (200-400 Hz) recurring at a
              frequency of 30-40 Hz. Our experiments demonstrate that the
              conventional notion of a totally desynchronized cortical activity
              upon arousal should be revised as fast rhythms are enhanced and
              synchronized within intracortical networks during brain
              activation. Spontaneously occurring, subthreshold membrane
              potential depolarizing oscillations may bias cortical and
              thalamic neurons to respond synchronously, at fast frequencies,
              to relevant stimuli in the wake state or to internally generated
              drives in REM sleep.",

              event-related potential (ERP), steady state visual evoked

              Although P300 BCIs were introduced over twenty years ago, the
              past few years have seen a strong increase in P300 BCI research.
              This closed-loop BCI approach relies on the P300 and other
              components of the ERP, based on an oddball paradigm presented to
              the subject. In this paper, we overview the current status of

              for eliciting P300s; signal processing methods; applications; and

                   Among the existing solutions the systems relying on
                   electroencephalograms (EEG) occupy the most prominent place
                   due to their non-invasiveness. However, the process of
                   translating EEG signals into computer commands is far from
                   trivial, since it requires the optimization of many
                   different parameters that need to be tuned jointly. In this
                   report, we focus on the category of EEG-based BCIs that rely
                   on Steady-State-Visual-Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) and
                   perform a comparative evaluation of the most promising
                   algorithms existing in the literature. More specifically, we
                   define a set of algorithms for each of the various different
                   parameters composing a BCI system (i.e. filtering, artifact
                   removal, feature extraction, feature selection and
                   classification) and study each parameter independently by
                   keeping all other parameters fixed. The results obtained
                   from this evaluation process are provided together with a
                   dataset consisting of the 256-channel, EEG signals of 11
                   subjects, as well as a processing toolbox for reproducing
