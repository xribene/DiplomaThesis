  abstract  = "This chapter introduces a formal categorization of BCIs,
               according to their key characteristics within HCI scenarios.
               This comprises classical approaches, which we group into active
               and reactive BCIs, and the new group of passive BCIs. Passive
               BCIs provide easily applicable and yet efficient interaction
               channels carrying information on covert aspects of user state,
               while adding little further usage cost. All of these systems can
               also be set up as hybrid BCIs, by incorporating information from
               outside the brain to make predictions, allowing for enhanced
               robustness over conventional approaches. With these properties,
               passive and hybrid BCIs are particularly useful in HCI. When any
               BCI is transferred from the laboratory to real-world situations,
               one faces new types of problems resulting from uncontrolled
               environmental factors---mostly leading to artifacts
               contaminating data and results. The handling of these situations
               is treated in a brief review of training and calibration
               strategies. The presented theory is then underpinned by two
               concrete examples. First, a combination of Event Related
               Desynchronization (ERD)-based active BCI with gaze control,
               defining a hybrid BCI as solution for the midas touch problem.
               And second, a passive BCI based on human error processing,
               leading to new forms of automated adaptation in HCI. This is in
               line with the results from other recent studies of passive BCI
               technology and shows the broad potential of this approach.",

              mechanisms underlying these impairments in various

              neuropsychophysiology. The endogenous event-related potential
              (ERP) approach is one of the instrumental neurophysiological
              methods that are currently used for assessing these complicated
              processes because recorded potentials reflect the intrinsic brain
              activity and changes in these potentials are caused by endogenous
              factors of the brain activity. The P300 cognitive evoked
              potential, induced by selective attention to a stimulus, has been
              the most widely used endogenous ERP. This potential may be
              helpful for studying mechanisms of mental disturbances, as it
              reflects neuronal processes connected with nonspecific activating
              reticulothalamic systems, as well as with limbic and neocortical
