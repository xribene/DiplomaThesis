  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: This study proposes and evaluates a novel data-driven
              spatial filtering approach for enhancing steady-state visual
              evoked potentials (SSVEPs) detection toward a high-speed
              brain-computer interface (BCI) speller. METHODS: Task-related
              component analysis (TRCA), which can enhance reproducibility of
              SSVEPs across multiple trials, was employed to improve the
              signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of SSVEP signals by removing
              background electroencephalographic (EEG) activities. An ensemble
              method was further developed to integrate TRCA filters
              corresponding to multiple stimulation frequencies. This study
              conducted a comparison of BCI performance between the proposed
              TRCA-based method and an extended canonical correlation analysis
              (CCA)-based method using a 40-class SSVEP dataset recorded from
              12 subjects. An online BCI speller was further implemented using
              a cue-guided target selection task with 20 subjects and a
              free-spelling task with 10 of the subjects. RESULTS: The offline
              comparison results indicate that the proposed TRCA-based approach
              can significantly improve the classification accuracy compared
              with the extended CCA-based method. Furthermore, the online BCI
              speller achieved averaged information transfer rates (ITRs) of
              325.33 $\pm$ 38.17 bits/min with the cue-guided task and 198.67
              $\pm$ 50.48 bits/min with the free-spelling task. CONCLUSION:
              This study validated the efficiency of the proposed TRCA-based
              method in implementing a high-speed SSVEP-based BCI.
              SIGNIFICANCE: The high-speed SSVEP-based BCIs using the TRCA
              method have great potential for various applications in
              communication and control.",

                   non-invasive neuroimaging techniques such as

                   however the dissemination of the technology is limited, in
                   part because of the price of the hardware. In this paper we
                   compare side by side two EEG amplifiers, the consumer grade
                   OpenBCI and the medical grade g.tec g.USBamp. For this
                   purpose, we employed an original montage, based on the
                   simultaneous recording of the same set of electrodes. Two
                   set of recordings were performed. During the first
                   experiment a simple adapter with a direct connection between
                   the amplifiers and the electrodes was used. Then, in a
                   second experiment, we attempted to discard any possible
                   interference that one amplifier could cause to the other by
                   adding ``ideal'' diodes to the adapter. Both spectral and

                   outperforms the OpenBCI, the latter gives very close EEG

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Bridging the gap between laboratory brain-computer
              interface (BCI) demonstrations and real-life applications has
              gained increasing attention nowadays in translational
              neuroscience. An urgent need is to explore the feasibility of
              using a low-cost, ease-of-use electroencephalogram (EEG) headset
              for monitoring individuals' EEG signals in their natural
              head/body positions and movements. This study aimed to assess the
              feasibility of using a consumer-level EEG headset to realize an
              online steady-state visual-evoked potential (SSVEP)-based BCI
              during human walking. METHODS: This study adopted a 14-channel
              Emotiv EEG headset to implement a four-target online SSVEP
              decoding system, and included treadmill walking at the speeds of
              0.45, 0.89, and 1.34 meters per second (m/s) to initiate the
              walking locomotion. Seventeen participants were instructed to
              perform the online BCI tasks while standing or walking on the
              treadmill. To maintain a constant viewing distance to the visual
              targets, participants held the hand-grip of the treadmill during
              the experiment. Along with online BCI performance, the concurrent
              SSVEP signals were recorded for offline assessment. RESULTS:
              Despite walking-related attenuation of SSVEPs, the online BCI
              obtained an information transfer rate (ITR) over 12 bits/min
              during slow walking (below 0.89 m/s). CONCLUSIONS: SSVEP-based
              BCI systems are deployable to users in treadmill walking that
              mimics natural walking rather than in highly-controlled
              laboratory settings. This study considerably promotes the use of
              a consumer-level EEG headset towards the real-life BCI
              applications.",

               An efficient SSVEP-based BCI system in shorter time with higher
               accuracy in recognizing SSVEP has been pursued by many studies.
               This paper introduces a novel multiway canonical correlation
               analysis (Multiway CCA) approach to recognize SSVEP. This
               approach is based on tensor CCA and focuses on multiway data
               arrays. Multiple CCAs are used to find appropriate reference
               signals for SSVEP recognition from different data arrays. SSVEP
               is then recognized by implementing multiple linear regression
               (MLR) between EEG and optimized reference signals. The proposed
               Multiway CCA is verified by comparing to the standard CCA and
               power spectral density analysis (PSDA). Results showed that the
               Multiway CCA achieved higher recognition accuracy within shorter
               time than that of the CCA and PSDA.",

              These generic reference templates may not optimally reflect the

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Today, the brain-computer interface (BCI) community
              lacks a standard method to evaluate an online BCI's performance.
              Even the most commonly used metric, the information transfer rate
              (ITR), is often reported differently, even incorrectly, in many
              papers, which is not conducive to BCI research. This paper aims
              to point out many of the existing problems and give some
              suggestions and methods to overcome these problems. APPROACH:
              First, the preconditions inherent in ITR calculation based on
              Wolpaw's definition are summarized and several incorrect ITR
              calculations, which go against the preconditions, are indicated.
              Then, the issues affecting ITR estimation during the test of
              online BCI systems are discussed in detail. Finally, a
              task-oriented online BCI test platform was proposed, which may
              help BCI evaluations in real-world applications. MAIN RESULTS:
              The guidelines for ITR calculation in online BCIs testing are
              proposed. The platform executed in the Beijing BCI Competition
              2010 shows that it can be used as a common way to compare the
              online performances (including the ITR) of existing BCI
              paradigms. SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed guidelines and
              task-oriented test platform may reduce the uncertainty and
              artifacts of online BCI performance evaluation; they provide a
              relatively objective way to compare different BCI's performances
              in real-world BCI applications, which is a forward step toward
              developing standards for BCI performance evaluation.",

                   due to their non-invasiveness. However, the process of
                   translating EEG signals into computer commands is far from
                   trivial, since it requires the optimization of many
                   different parameters that need to be tuned jointly. In this
                   report, we focus on the category of EEG-based BCIs that rely

                   perform a comparative evaluation of the most promising

               appliances without involving the normal output pathways of
               peripheral nerves and muscles. A particularly promising type of
               BCI is based on the Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential
               (SSVEP). Users can select commands by focusing on visual stimuli
               that alternate appearance with a certain frequency. The
               properties of these stimuli, such as size and color, as well as
               the device they are rendered on, can significantly affect the
               performance, comfort and safety of the system. However, the
               choice of stimulation properties is often ad-hoc or copied. In
               this paper we report our findings about the effects of rendering
               device, refresh rate, environmental illumination, contrast,
               color, spatial frequency and size of visual stimuli. In order to
               investigate these effects online, a high-performance BCI was
               developed. User comfort was measured using a questionnaire. The
               results suggest that high contrast stimulation works the best,
               while also being the least comfortable. However, maximum
               black/white contrast is often not needed and other stimuli (e.g.
               blue/green stimulation) are shown to work almost as well, while
               being far more comfortable. Knowledge of these effects can help
               to improve SSVEP-based BCIs.",

  abstract = "Introduction The main idea of a traditional Steady State Visually
              Evoked Potentials (SSVEP)-BCI is the activation of commands
              through gaze control. For this purpose, the retina of the eye is
              excited by a stimulus at a certain frequency. Several studies
              have shown effects related to different kind of stimuli,
              frequencies, window lengths, techniques of feature extraction and
              even classification. So far, none of the previous studies has
              performed a comparison of performance of stimuli colors through
              LED technology. This study addresses precisely this important
              aspect and would be a great contribution to the topic of
              SSVEP-BCIs. Additionally, the performance of different colors at
              different frequencies and the visual comfort were evaluated in
              each case. Methods LEDs of four different colors (red, green,
              blue and yellow) flickering at four distinct frequencies (8, 11,
              13 and 15 Hz) were used. Twenty subjects were distributed in two
              groups performing different protocols. Multivariate
              Synchronization Index (MSI) was the technique adopted as feature
              extractor. Results The accuracy was gradually enhanced with the
              increase of the time window. From our observations, the red color
              provides, in most frequencies, both highest rates of accuracy and
              Information Transfer Rate (ITR) for detection of SSVEP.
              Conclusion Although the red color has presented higher ITR, this
              color was turned in the less comfortable one and can even elicit
              epileptic responses according to the literature. For this reason,
              the green color is suggested as the best choice according to the
              proposed rules. In addition, this color has shown to be safe and
              accurate for an SSVEP-BCI.",

              This study presents an electroencephalogram-based BCI speller
              that can achieve information transfer rates (ITRs) up to 5.32
              bits per second, the highest ITRs reported in BCI spellers using

              flickering signals and the elicited single-trial steady-state
              visual evoked potentials, this study developed a synchronous

              Specifically, this study proposed a new joint frequency-phase
              modulation method to tag 40 characters with 0.5-s-long flickering

               all studies share a common purpose-to relate scalp potentials to
               the underlying neurophysiology. Electrical potentials on the
               scalp exhibit spatial and temporal patterns that depend on the
               nature and location of the sources and the way that currents and
               fields spread through tissue. Because these dynamic patterns are
               correlated with behavior and cognition, EEG provides a ``window
               on the mind,'' correlating physiology and psychology. This
               classic and widely acclaimed text, originally published in 1981,
               filled the large gap between EEG and the physical sciences. It
               has now been brought completely up to date and will again serve
               as an invaluable resource for understanding the principles of

  abstract = "The human brain has often been viewed as outstanding among
              mammalian brains: the most cognitively able, the
              largest-than-expected from body size, endowed with an
              overdeveloped cerebral cortex that represents over 80\% of brain
              mass, and purportedly containing 100 billion neurons and 10x more
              glial cells. Such uniqueness was seemingly necessary to justify
              the superior cognitive abilities of humans over larger-brained
              mammals such as elephants and whales. However, our recent studies
              using a novel method to determine the cellular composition of the
              brain of humans and other primates as well as of rodents and
              insectivores show that, since different cellular scaling rules
              apply to the brains within these orders, brain size can no longer
              be considered a proxy for the number of neurons in the brain.
              These studies also showed that the human brain is not exceptional
              in its cellular composition, as it was found to contain as many
              neuronal and non-neuronal cells as would be expected of a primate
              brain of its size. Additionally, the so-called overdeveloped
              human cerebral cortex holds only 19\% of all brain neurons, a
              fraction that is similar to that found in other mammals. In what
              regards absolute numbers of neurons, however, the human brain
              does have two advantages compared to other mammalian brains:
              compared to rodents, and probably to whales and elephants as
              well, it is built according to the very economical, space-saving
              scaling rules that apply to other primates; and, among
              economically built primate brains, it is the largest, hence
              containing the most neurons. These findings argue in favor of a
              view of cognitive abilities that is centered on absolute numbers
              of neurons, rather than on body size or encephalization, and call
              for a re-examination of several concepts related to the

               differnt frequency domains. The amplitude surface with the
               change of both frequencies and duty cycles is plotted. To get a
               stable response, the experiment arranged in 3 days, and each
               result is an average of 12 repetitions. It is interesting that
               the results from power spectral density (PSD) and canonical
               correlation analysis (CCA) method are not consistent. In
               addition, the relation between the fundamental component and its
               second harmonic component with the change of duty cycle is quite
               different at frequency of 7Hz, 10Hz and 13Hz. Based on the
               amplitude surface, we try to configure the subject-specific
               SSVEP based BCI. The frequencies and duty cycles of the stimulus
               are selected corresponding to the higher SSVEP response in the
               amplitude surface. Cross validation results show a significant
               improvement in the performance for the adjustment of duty cycle.",

               historical account of the many innovations and innovators on
               whose work the field rests. This is accompanied by a discussion
               of both the theories and experiments which were contributed to
               the development of the field. The physiological origin of
               bioelectric and biomagnetic signal is discussed in detail. The
               sensitivity in a given measurement situation, the energy
               distribution in stimulation with the same electrodes, and the
               measurement of impedance are related and described by the
               electrode lead field. It is shown that, based on the reciprocity
               theorem, these are identical and further, that these procedures
               apply equally well for biomagnetic considerations. The
               difference between corresponding bioelectric and biomagnetic
               methods is discussed. The book shows, that all subfields of
               bioelectromagnetism obey the same basic laws and they are
               closely tied together through the principle of reciprocity. Thus

               This comprises classical approaches, which we group into active
               and reactive BCIs, and the new group of passive BCIs. Passive
               BCIs provide easily applicable and yet efficient interaction
               channels carrying information on covert aspects of user state,
               while adding little further usage cost. All of these systems can
               also be set up as hybrid BCIs, by incorporating information from
               outside the brain to make predictions, allowing for enhanced
               robustness over conventional approaches. With these properties,
               passive and hybrid BCIs are particularly useful in HCI. When any
               BCI is transferred from the laboratory to real-world situations,
               one faces new types of problems resulting from uncontrolled
               environmental factors---mostly leading to artifacts
               contaminating data and results. The handling of these situations
               is treated in a brief review of training and calibration
               strategies. The presented theory is then underpinned by two
               concrete examples. First, a combination of Event Related
               Desynchronization (ERD)-based active BCI with gaze control,
               defining a hybrid BCI as solution for the midas touch problem.
               And second, a passive BCI based on human error processing,
               leading to new forms of automated adaptation in HCI. This is in
               line with the results from other recent studies of passive BCI
               technology and shows the broad potential of this approach.",

              by means of simultaneous extra- and intracellular recordings from
              multiple neocortical areas. Fast Fourier transforms, auto- and
              cross-correlations, and spike- or wave-triggered averages were
              used to determine the frequency and temporal coherence of fast
              oscillations that outlasted the stimulation of ascending
              activating systems or that occurred naturally during behavioral
              states of waking and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep but also
              appeared during the depolarizing phases of slow sleep
              oscillations. In 90\% of microelectrode tracks, the fast
              oscillations did not show field reversal at any depth of the
              cortex and were not observable in the underlying white matter.
              The negative field potentials of the fast oscillations were
              associated at all depths with neuronal firing. This field
              potential property of fast oscillations was in sharp contrast to
              the reversal of slow sleep oscillation or evoked potentials at
              depths of 0.25-0.5 mm. The coherence of fast spontaneous rhythms
              was spatially limited, being confined within a cortical column
              and among closely located neocortical sites, in contrast to the
              long-range synchronization of slow sleep rhythms. Depolarizing
              current pulses elicited spike-bursts (200-400 Hz) recurring at a
              frequency of 30-40 Hz. Our experiments demonstrate that the
              conventional notion of a totally desynchronized cortical activity
              upon arousal should be revised as fast rhythms are enhanced and
              synchronized within intracortical networks during brain
              activation. Spontaneously occurring, subthreshold membrane
              potential depolarizing oscillations may bias cortical and
              thalamic neurons to respond synchronously, at fast frequencies,
              to relevant stimuli in the wake state or to internally generated
              drives in REM sleep.",

              event-related potential (ERP), steady state visual evoked

              Although P300 BCIs were introduced over twenty years ago, the
              past few years have seen a strong increase in P300 BCI research.
              This closed-loop BCI approach relies on the P300 and other
              components of the ERP, based on an oddball paradigm presented to
              the subject. In this paper, we overview the current status of

              for eliciting P300s; signal processing methods; applications; and

                   Among the existing solutions the systems relying on
                   electroencephalograms (EEG) occupy the most prominent place
                   due to their non-invasiveness. However, the process of
                   translating EEG signals into computer commands is far from
                   trivial, since it requires the optimization of many
                   different parameters that need to be tuned jointly. In this
                   report, we focus on the category of EEG-based BCIs that rely
                   on Steady-State-Visual-Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) and
                   perform a comparative evaluation of the most promising
                   algorithms existing in the literature. More specifically, we
                   define a set of algorithms for each of the various different
                   parameters composing a BCI system (i.e. filtering, artifact
                   removal, feature extraction, feature selection and
                   classification) and study each parameter independently by
                   keeping all other parameters fixed. The results obtained
                   from this evaluation process are provided together with a
                   dataset consisting of the 256-channel, EEG signals of 11
                   subjects, as well as a processing toolbox for reproducing
