  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: This study proposes and evaluates a novel data-driven
              spatial filtering approach for enhancing steady-state visual
              evoked potentials (SSVEPs) detection toward a high-speed
              brain-computer interface (BCI) speller. METHODS: Task-related
              component analysis (TRCA), which can enhance reproducibility of
              SSVEPs across multiple trials, was employed to improve the
              signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of SSVEP signals by removing
              background electroencephalographic (EEG) activities. An ensemble
              method was further developed to integrate TRCA filters
              corresponding to multiple stimulation frequencies. This study
              conducted a comparison of BCI performance between the proposed
              TRCA-based method and an extended canonical correlation analysis
              (CCA)-based method using a 40-class SSVEP dataset recorded from
              12 subjects. An online BCI speller was further implemented using
              a cue-guided target selection task with 20 subjects and a
              free-spelling task with 10 of the subjects. RESULTS: The offline
              comparison results indicate that the proposed TRCA-based approach
              can significantly improve the classification accuracy compared
              with the extended CCA-based method. Furthermore, the online BCI
              speller achieved averaged information transfer rates (ITRs) of
              325.33 $\pm$ 38.17 bits/min with the cue-guided task and 198.67
              $\pm$ 50.48 bits/min with the free-spelling task. CONCLUSION:
              This study validated the efficiency of the proposed TRCA-based
              method in implementing a high-speed SSVEP-based BCI.
              SIGNIFICANCE: The high-speed SSVEP-based BCIs using the TRCA

                   however the dissemination of the technology is limited, in
                   part because of the price of the hardware. In this paper we
                   compare side by side two EEG amplifiers, the consumer grade
                   OpenBCI and the medical grade g.tec g.USBamp. For this
                   purpose, we employed an original montage, based on the
                   simultaneous recording of the same set of electrodes. Two
                   set of recordings were performed. During the first
                   experiment a simple adapter with a direct connection between
                   the amplifiers and the electrodes was used. Then, in a
                   second experiment, we attempted to discard any possible
                   interference that one amplifier could cause to the other by
                   adding ``ideal'' diodes to the adapter. Both spectral and

                   outperforms the OpenBCI, the latter gives very close EEG
                   readings, resulting in practice in a classification accuracy

              interface (BCI) demonstrations and real-life applications has
              gained increasing attention nowadays in translational
              neuroscience. An urgent need is to explore the feasibility of
              using a low-cost, ease-of-use electroencephalogram (EEG) headset
              for monitoring individuals' EEG signals in their natural
              head/body positions and movements. This study aimed to assess the
              feasibility of using a consumer-level EEG headset to realize an
              online steady-state visual-evoked potential (SSVEP)-based BCI
              during human walking. METHODS: This study adopted a 14-channel
              Emotiv EEG headset to implement a four-target online SSVEP
              decoding system, and included treadmill walking at the speeds of
              0.45, 0.89, and 1.34 meters per second (m/s) to initiate the
              walking locomotion. Seventeen participants were instructed to
              perform the online BCI tasks while standing or walking on the
              treadmill. To maintain a constant viewing distance to the visual
              targets, participants held the hand-grip of the treadmill during
              the experiment. Along with online BCI performance, the concurrent
              SSVEP signals were recorded for offline assessment. RESULTS:
              Despite walking-related attenuation of SSVEPs, the online BCI
              obtained an information transfer rate (ITR) over 12 bits/min
              during slow walking (below 0.89 m/s). CONCLUSIONS: SSVEP-based
              BCI systems are deployable to users in treadmill walking that
              mimics natural walking rather than in highly-controlled
              laboratory settings. This study considerably promotes the use of
              a consumer-level EEG headset towards the real-life BCI

              activation of letters, false positives due to inappropriate dwell
              times are avoided. This novel approach combines the high speed of
              eye tracking systems and the high classification accuracies of
              low target SSVEP-based BCIs, leading to an optimal combination of

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: Brain computer interfaces (BCI) enable direct
               communication with a computer, using neural activity as the
               control signal. This neural signal is generally chosen from a
               variety of well-studied electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. For
               a given BCI paradigm, feature extractors and classifiers are
               tailored to the distinct characteristics of its expected EEG
               control signal, limiting its application to that specific
               signal. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which have been
               used in computer vision and speech recognition to perform
               automatic feature extraction and classification, have
               successfully been applied to EEG-based BCIs; however, they have
               mainly been applied to single BCI paradigms and thus it remains
               unclear how these architectures generalize to other paradigms.
               Here, we ask if we can design a single CNN architecture to
               accurately classify EEG signals from different BCI paradigms,
               while simultaneously being as compact as possible. APPROACH: In
               this work we introduce EEGNet, a compact convolutional neural
               network for EEG-based BCIs. We introduce the use of depthwise
               and separable convolutions to construct an EEG-specific model
               which encapsulates well-known EEG feature extraction concepts
               for BCI. We compare EEGNet, both for within-subject and
               cross-subject classification, to current state-of-the-art
               approaches across four BCI paradigms: P300 visual-evoked
               potentials, error-related negativity responses (ERN),
               movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP), and sensory motor
               rhythms (SMR). RESULTS: We show that EEGNet generalizes across
               paradigms better than, and achieves comparably high performance
               to, the reference algorithms when only limited training data is
               available across all tested paradigms. In addition, we
               demonstrate three different approaches to visualize the contents
               of a trained EEGNet model to enable interpretation of the
               learned features. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that EEGNet
               is robust enough to learn a wide variety of interpretable

              brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) generate weak SSVEP with a
              monitor and cannot use harmonic frequencies, whereas P300-based
              BCIs need multiple stimulation sequences. These issues can
              decrease the information transfer rate (ITR). NEW METHOD: In this
              paper, we introduce a novel hybrid SSVEP-P300 speller that
              generates dual-frequency SSVEP, allowing it to overcome the
              abovementioned limitations and improve the performance. The
              hybrid speller consists of nine panels flickering at different
              frequencies. Each panel contains four different characters that
              appear in a random sequence. The flickering panel and the
              periodically updating character evoke the dual-frequency SSVEP,
              while the oddball stimulus of the target character evokes the
              P300. A canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and a step-wise
              linear discriminant analysis (SWLDA) classified SSVEP and P300,
              respectively. Ten subjects participated in offline and online
              experiments, in which accuracy and ITR were compared with those
              of conventional SSVEP and P300 spellers. RESULTS: The offline
              analysis revealed not only the P300 potential but also SSVEP with
              peaks at sub-harmonic frequencies, demonstrating that the
              proposed speller elicited dual-frequency SSVEP. This
              dual-frequency stimulation improved SSVEP recognition, increased
              the number of targets by employing harmonic frequencies, reduced
              the stimulation time for P300, and consequently improved ITR as
              compared to the conventional spellers. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING
              METHODS: The new method reduces the stimulation time and allows
              harmonic frequencies to be employed for different stimuli.
              CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that this study provides a
              promising approach to make the BCI speller more reliable and

              (hBCI) technologies for improving classification accuracy and
              increasing the number of commands are reviewed. Hybridization
              combining more than two modalities is a new trend in brain
              imaging and prosthesis control. Electroencephalography (EEG), due
              to its easy use and fast temporal resolution, is most widely
              utilized in combination with other brain/non-brain signal
              acquisition modalities, for instance, functional near infrared
              spectroscopy (fNIRS), electromyography (EMG), electrooculography
              (EOG), and eye tracker. Three main purposes of hybridization are
              to increase the number of control commands, improve
              classification accuracy and reduce the signal detection time.
              Currently, such combinations of EEG + fNIRS and EEG + EOG are
              most commonly employed. Four principal components (i.e.,
              hardware, paradigm, classifiers, and features) relevant to
              accuracy improvement are discussed. In the case of brain signals,
              motor imagination/movement tasks are combined with cognitive
              tasks to increase active brain-computer interface (BCI) accuracy.
              Active and reactive tasks sometimes are combined: motor
              imagination with steady-state evoked visual potentials (SSVEP)
              and motor imagination with P300. In the case of reactive tasks,
              SSVEP is most widely combined with P300 to increase the number of
              commands. Passive BCIs, however, are rare. After discussing the
              hardware and strategies involved in the development of hBCI, the
              second part examines the approaches used to increase the number
              of control commands and to enhance classification accuracy. The
              future prospects and the extension of hBCI in real-time
              applications for daily life scenarios are provided.",

  abstract = "In brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that use the steady-state
              visual evoked response (SSVEP), the user selects a control
              command by directing attention overtly or covertly to one out of
              several flicker stimuli. The different control channels are
              encoded in the frequency, phase, or time domain of the flicker
              signals. Here, we present a new type of SSVEP BCI, which uses
              only a single flicker stimulus and yet affords controlling
              multiple channels. The approach rests on the observation that the
              relative position between the stimulus and the foci of overt
              attention result in distinct topographies of the SSVEP response
              on the scalp. By classifying these topographies, the computer can
              determine at which position the user is gazing. Offline data
              analysis in a study on 12 healthy volunteers revealed that 9
              targets can be recognized with about 95$\pm$3\% accuracy,
              corresponding to an information transfer rate (ITR) of 40.8 $\pm$
              3.3 b/min on average. We explored how the classification accuracy
              is affected by the number of control channels, the trial length,
              and the number of EEG channels. Our findings suggest that the EEG
              data from five channels over parieto-occipital brain areas are
              sufficient for reliably classifying the topographies and that
              there is a large potential to improve the ITR by optimizing the
              trial length. The robust performance and the simple stimulation

              for a high number of commands. However, such flickering stimuli
              often also cause user discomfort and fatigue, especially when
              several light sources are used simultaneously. Different
              variations of SSVEP driving signals have been proposed to
              increase user comfort. Here, we investigate the suitability of
              frequency modulation of a high frequency carrier for SSVEP-BCIs.
              We compared BCI performance and user experience between frequency
              modulated (FM) and traditional sinusoidal (SIN) SSVEPs in an
              offline classification paradigm with four independently
              flickering light-emitting diodes which were overtly attended

              with the FM stimuli, the user comfort was significantly
              increased. Comparing the SSVEPs for covert attention to the
              stimuli (without fixation) was not possible, as no reliable
              SSVEPs were evoked. Our results reveal that several,
              simultaneously flickering, light emitting diodes can be used to
              generate FM-SSVEPs with different frequencies and the resulting
              occipital electroencephalography (EEG) signals can be classified
              with high accuracy. While the performance we report could be
              further improved with adjusted stimuli and algorithms, we argue
              that the increased comfort is an important result and suggest the
              use of FM stimuli for future SSVEP-BCI applications.",

              whether joint angle velocities or movement synergies are the
              optimal kinematics spaces to decode. In this offline decoding
              study, we infer from human EEG, hand joint angular velocities as
              well as synergistic trajectories as subjects perform natural
              reach-to-grasp movements. Decoding accuracy, measured as the
              correlation coefficient (r) between the predicted and actual
              movement kinematics, was r = 0.49 $\pm$ 0.02 across 15 hand
              joints. Across the first three kinematic synergies, decoding
              accuracies were r = 0.59 $\pm$ 0.04, 0.47 $\pm$ 0.06, and 0.32

              Information content in EEG about the grasp type peaked at 250 ms

              neural ``symphony'' as opposed to local members of the neural

              extracting information about motor intent for grasping without

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are developed to
              translate brain waves into machine instructions for external
              devices control. Recently, hybrid BCI systems are proposed for
              the multi-degree control of a real wheelchair to improve the
              systematical efficiency of traditional BCIs. However, it is
              difficult for existing hybrid BCIs to implement the
              multi-dimensional control in one command cycle. NEW METHOD: This
              paper proposes a novel hybrid BCI system that combines motor
              imagery (MI)-based bio-signals and steady-state visual evoked
              potentials (SSVEPs) to control the speed and direction of a real
              wheelchair synchronously. Furthermore, a hybrid modalities-based
              switch is firstly designed to turn on/off the control system of
              the wheelchair. RESULTS: Two experiments were performed to assess
              the proposed BCI system. One was implemented for training and the
              other one conducted a wheelchair control task in the real
              environment. All subjects completed these tasks successfully and
              no collisions occurred in the real wheelchair control experiment.
              COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): The protocol of our BCI gave
              much more control commands than those of previous MI and
              SSVEP-based BCIs. Comparing with other BCI wheelchair systems,
              the superiority reflected by the index of path length optimality
              ratio validated the high efficiency of our control strategy.
              CONCLUSIONS: The results validated the efficiency of our hybrid
              BCI system to control the direction and speed of a real
              wheelchair as well as the reliability of hybrid signals-based

              prostheses are reduced with increasing amputation level. In
              addition, for electromyography-based control of prostheses, the
              residual muscles alone cannot generate sufficiently different
              signals for accurate distal arm function. Thus, controlling a
              multi-degree of freedom (DoF) transhumeral prosthesis is
              challenging with currently available techniques. In this paper,
              an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based hierarchical two-stage
              approach is proposed to achieve multi-DoF control of a
              transhumeral prosthesis. In the proposed method, the motion
              intention for arm reaching or hand lifting is identified using
              classifiers trained with motion-related EEG features. For this
              purpose, neural network and k-nearest neighbor classifiers are
              used. Then, elbow motion and hand endpoint motion is estimated

              are trained with motion information recorded using healthy

              which uses sinusoidal signals as reference signals, was first
              proposed for SSVEP detection without calibration. However, the
              detection performance can be deteriorated by the interference

               An efficient SSVEP-based BCI system in shorter time with higher

               This paper introduces a novel multiway canonical correlation

               approach is based on tensor CCA and focuses on multiway data

               signals for SSVEP recognition from different data arrays. SSVEP
               is then recognized by implementing multiple linear regression
               (MLR) between EEG and optimized reference signals. The proposed
               Multiway CCA is verified by comparing to the standard CCA and
               power spectral density analysis (PSDA). Results showed that the
               Multiway CCA achieved higher recognition accuracy within shorter

              electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in specific frequency
              bands over sensorimotor cortex and use it to move a cursor to a
              target on a computer screen. EEG-based communication could
              provide a new augmentative communication channel for individuals
              with motor disabilities. In the present system, each dimension of
              cursor movement is controlled by a linear equation. While the
              intercept in the equation is continually updated, it does not
              perfectly eliminate the impact of spontaneous variations in EEG
              amplitude. This imperfection reduces the accuracy of cursor
              movement. We evaluated a response verification (RV) procedure in
              which each outcome is determined by two opposite trials (e.g.,
              one top-target trial and one bottom-target trial). Success, or
              failure, on both is required for a definitive outcome. The RV
              procedure reduces errors due to imperfection in intercept
              selection. Accuracy for opposite-trial pairs exceeds that
              predicted from the accuracies of individual trials, and greatly
              exceeds that for same-trial pairs. The RV procedure should be
              particularly valuable when the first trial has >2 possible
              targets, because the second trial need only confirm or deny the
              outcome of the first, and it should be applicable to nonlinear as

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Today, the brain-computer interface (BCI) community
              lacks a standard method to evaluate an online BCI's performance.
              Even the most commonly used metric, the information transfer rate
              (ITR), is often reported differently, even incorrectly, in many
              papers, which is not conducive to BCI research. This paper aims
              to point out many of the existing problems and give some
              suggestions and methods to overcome these problems. APPROACH:
              First, the preconditions inherent in ITR calculation based on
              Wolpaw's definition are summarized and several incorrect ITR
              calculations, which go against the preconditions, are indicated.
              Then, the issues affecting ITR estimation during the test of
              online BCI systems are discussed in detail. Finally, a
              task-oriented online BCI test platform was proposed, which may
              help BCI evaluations in real-world applications. MAIN RESULTS:
              The guidelines for ITR calculation in online BCIs testing are
              proposed. The platform executed in the Beijing BCI Competition
              2010 shows that it can be used as a common way to compare the
              online performances (including the ITR) of existing BCI
              paradigms. SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed guidelines and
              task-oriented test platform may reduce the uncertainty and
              artifacts of online BCI performance evaluation; they provide a
              relatively objective way to compare different BCI's performances
              in real-world BCI applications, which is a forward step toward
              developing standards for BCI performance evaluation.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) are
              widely used for brain-computer interfaces. However, users
              experience fatigue due to exposure to flickering stimuli.
              High-frequency stimulation has been proposed to reduce this
              problem. We adapt frequency-modulated (FM) stimulation from the
              auditory domain, where it is commonly used to evoke steady-state
              responses, and compare the EEG as well as behavioral flicker
              perceptibility ratings. NEW METHOD: We evoke SSVEPs with a green
              light-emitting diode (LED) driven by FM signals. RESULTS:
              FM-SSVEPs with different carrier and modulation frequencies can
              reliably be evoked with spectral peaks at the lower FM sideband.
              Subjective perceptibility ratings decrease with increasing FM
              carrier frequencies, while the peak amplitude and signal-to-noise
              ratio (SNR) remain the same. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD:
              There are neither amplitude nor SNR differences between SSVEPs
              evoked rectangularly, sinusoidally or via FM. Perceptibility
              ratings were lower for FM-SSVEPs with carrier frequencies of 20Hz
              and above than for sinusoidally evoked SSVEPs. CONCLUSIONS:
              FM-SSVEPs seem to be beneficial for BCI usage. Reduced flicker
              perceptibility in FM-SSVEPs suggests reduced fatigue, which leads
              to an enhanced user experience and performance.",

                   Among the existing solutions the systems relying on
                   electroencephalograms (EEG) occupy the most prominent place
                   due to their non-invasiveness. However, the process of
                   translating EEG signals into computer commands is far from
                   trivial, since it requires the optimization of many
                   different parameters that need to be tuned jointly. In this
                   report, we focus on the category of EEG-based BCIs that rely
                   on Steady-State-Visual-Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) and
                   perform a comparative evaluation of the most promising
                   algorithms existing in the literature. More specifically, we
                   define a set of algorithms for each of the various different
                   parameters composing a BCI system (i.e. filtering, artifact

  abstract = "Introduction The main idea of a traditional Steady State Visually
              Evoked Potentials (SSVEP)-BCI is the activation of commands
              through gaze control. For this purpose, the retina of the eye is
              excited by a stimulus at a certain frequency. Several studies
              have shown effects related to different kind of stimuli,
              frequencies, window lengths, techniques of feature extraction and
              even classification. So far, none of the previous studies has
              performed a comparison of performance of stimuli colors through
              LED technology. This study addresses precisely this important
              aspect and would be a great contribution to the topic of
              SSVEP-BCIs. Additionally, the performance of different colors at
              different frequencies and the visual comfort were evaluated in
              each case. Methods LEDs of four different colors (red, green,
              blue and yellow) flickering at four distinct frequencies (8, 11,
              13 and 15 Hz) were used. Twenty subjects were distributed in two
              groups performing different protocols. Multivariate
              Synchronization Index (MSI) was the technique adopted as feature
              extractor. Results The accuracy was gradually enhanced with the
              increase of the time window. From our observations, the red color
              provides, in most frequencies, both highest rates of accuracy and
              Information Transfer Rate (ITR) for detection of SSVEP.
              Conclusion Although the red color has presented higher ITR, this
              color was turned in the less comfortable one and can even elicit
              epileptic responses according to the literature. For this reason,
              the green color is suggested as the best choice according to the
              proposed rules. In addition, this color has shown to be safe and
              accurate for an SSVEP-BCI.",

              This study presents an electroencephalogram-based BCI speller
              that can achieve information transfer rates (ITRs) up to 5.32
              bits per second, the highest ITRs reported in BCI spellers using

  abstract = "Evoked responses or event related potentials in human EEG have
              been mostly studied with off-line analog recording and averaging.
              It is shown here that, at least in some situations, it is
              possible to detect and classify individual evoked responses or
              ``single epochs'' with surprising reliability. To do so, however,
              requited thinking a new not only the data processing but the
              whole experimental strategy. The classification is done in
              real-time by treating the experiments as a signal detection
              problem in which the computer, in the position of impartial
              observer, assigns classes to incoming epochs accogding to a
              predetermined decision rule. Since data collection and processing
              are interleaved, each classification outcome can be a factor in
              experiment control as well as in subject feedback. The
              discrimination performance, expressed in terms of mutual
              information, is shown to be both a practical index for procedure
              optimization and a concise and specific descriptor for the

  abstract  = "Electroencephalography (EEG) is practiced by neurologists,
               cognitive neuroscientists, and others interested in functional
               brain imaging. Whether for clinical or experimental purposes,
               all studies share a common purpose-to relate scalp potentials to
               the underlying neurophysiology. Electrical potentials on the
               scalp exhibit spatial and temporal patterns that depend on the
               nature and location of the sources and the way that currents and
               fields spread through tissue. Because these dynamic patterns are
               correlated with behavior and cognition, EEG provides a ``window
               on the mind,'' correlating physiology and psychology. This
               classic and widely acclaimed text, originally published in 1981,
               filled the large gap between EEG and the physical sciences. It
               has now been brought completely up to date and will again serve
               as an invaluable resource for understanding the principles of
               electric fields in living tissue and for using hard science to
               study human consciousness and cognition. No comparable volume
               exists for it is no easy task to explain the problems of EEG in
               clear language, with mathematics presented mainly in appendices.
               Among the many topics covered by the Second Edition are micro
               and meso (intermediate scale) synaptic sources, electrode
               placement, choice of reference, volume conduction, power and
               coherence measures, projection of scalp potentials to dura
               surface, dynamic signatures of conscious experience, neural
               networks immersed in global fields of synaptic action, and
               physiological bases for brain source dynamics. The Second
               Edition is an invaluable resource for neurologists,
               neuroscientists (especially cognitive neuroscientists),
               biomedical engineers, and their students and trainees. It will
               also appeal to physicists, mathematicians, computer scientists,

@ARTICLE{Herculano-Houzel2009-vm,
  title    = "The human brain in numbers: a linearly scaled-up primate brain",
  author   = "Herculano-Houzel, Suzana",
  abstract = "The human brain has often been viewed as outstanding among
              mammalian brains: the most cognitively able, the
              largest-than-expected from body size, endowed with an
              overdeveloped cerebral cortex that represents over 80\% of brain
              mass, and purportedly containing 100 billion neurons and 10x more
              glial cells. Such uniqueness was seemingly necessary to justify
              the superior cognitive abilities of humans over larger-brained
              mammals such as elephants and whales. However, our recent studies
              using a novel method to determine the cellular composition of the
              brain of humans and other primates as well as of rodents and
              insectivores show that, since different cellular scaling rules
              apply to the brains within these orders, brain size can no longer
              be considered a proxy for the number of neurons in the brain.
              These studies also showed that the human brain is not exceptional
              in its cellular composition, as it was found to contain as many
              neuronal and non-neuronal cells as would be expected of a primate
              brain of its size. Additionally, the so-called overdeveloped
              human cerebral cortex holds only 19\% of all brain neurons, a
              fraction that is similar to that found in other mammals. In what
              regards absolute numbers of neurons, however, the human brain
              does have two advantages compared to other mammalian brains:
              compared to rodents, and probably to whales and elephants as
              well, it is built according to the very economical, space-saving
              scaling rules that apply to other primates; and, among
              economically built primate brains, it is the largest, hence
              containing the most neurons. These findings argue in favor of a
              view of cognitive abilities that is centered on absolute numbers
              of neurons, rather than on body size or encephalization, and call
              for a re-examination of several concepts related to the
              exceptionality of the human brain.",

               whose work the field rests. This is accompanied by a discussion
               of both the theories and experiments which were contributed to
               the development of the field. The physiological origin of
               bioelectric and biomagnetic signal is discussed in detail. The
               sensitivity in a given measurement situation, the energy
               distribution in stimulation with the same electrodes, and the
               measurement of impedance are related and described by the
               electrode lead field. It is shown that, based on the reciprocity
               theorem, these are identical and further, that these procedures
               apply equally well for biomagnetic considerations. The
               difference between corresponding bioelectric and biomagnetic
               methods is discussed. The book shows, that all subfields of

               closely tied together through the principle of reciprocity. Thus

              brain-computer communication. In this work, a BCI system is
              introduced based on steady-state somatosensory evoked potentials
              (SSSEPs). Transducers have been used for the stimulation of both
              index fingers using tactile stimulation in the ``resonance''-like
              frequency range of the somatosensory system. Four subjects
              participated in the experiments and were trained to modulate
              induced SSSEPs. Two of them learned to modify the patterns in
              order to set up a BCI with an accuracy of between 70\% and 80\%.
              Results presented in this work give evidence that it is possible
              to set up a BCI which is based on SSSEPs.",

               according to their key characteristics within HCI scenarios.
               This comprises classical approaches, which we group into active
               and reactive BCIs, and the new group of passive BCIs. Passive
               BCIs provide easily applicable and yet efficient interaction
               channels carrying information on covert aspects of user state,
               while adding little further usage cost. All of these systems can
               also be set up as hybrid BCIs, by incorporating information from
               outside the brain to make predictions, allowing for enhanced
               robustness over conventional approaches. With these properties,
               passive and hybrid BCIs are particularly useful in HCI. When any
               BCI is transferred from the laboratory to real-world situations,
               one faces new types of problems resulting from uncontrolled
               environmental factors---mostly leading to artifacts
               contaminating data and results. The handling of these situations
               is treated in a brief review of training and calibration
               strategies. The presented theory is then underpinned by two
               concrete examples. First, a combination of Event Related
               Desynchronization (ERD)-based active BCI with gaze control,
               defining a hybrid BCI as solution for the midas touch problem.
               And second, a passive BCI based on human error processing,
               leading to new forms of automated adaptation in HCI. This is in
               line with the results from other recent studies of passive BCI
               technology and shows the broad potential of this approach.",

  abstract = "We investigated the synchronization of fast spontaneous
              oscillations (mainly 30-40 Hz) in anesthetized and behaving cats
              by means of simultaneous extra- and intracellular recordings from
              multiple neocortical areas. Fast Fourier transforms, auto- and
              cross-correlations, and spike- or wave-triggered averages were
              used to determine the frequency and temporal coherence of fast
              oscillations that outlasted the stimulation of ascending
              activating systems or that occurred naturally during behavioral
              states of waking and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep but also
              appeared during the depolarizing phases of slow sleep
              oscillations. In 90\% of microelectrode tracks, the fast
              oscillations did not show field reversal at any depth of the
              cortex and were not observable in the underlying white matter.
              The negative field potentials of the fast oscillations were
              associated at all depths with neuronal firing. This field
              potential property of fast oscillations was in sharp contrast to
              the reversal of slow sleep oscillation or evoked potentials at
              depths of 0.25-0.5 mm. The coherence of fast spontaneous rhythms
              was spatially limited, being confined within a cortical column
              and among closely located neocortical sites, in contrast to the
              long-range synchronization of slow sleep rhythms. Depolarizing
              current pulses elicited spike-bursts (200-400 Hz) recurring at a
              frequency of 30-40 Hz. Our experiments demonstrate that the
              conventional notion of a totally desynchronized cortical activity
              upon arousal should be revised as fast rhythms are enhanced and
              synchronized within intracortical networks during brain
              activation. Spontaneously occurring, subthreshold membrane
              potential depolarizing oscillations may bias cortical and
              thalamic neurons to respond synchronously, at fast frequencies,
              to relevant stimuli in the wake state or to internally generated
              drives in REM sleep.",

              range of experimental observations. At the network level,
              reactivations during sleep of neuronal assemblies recently
              challenged by new environmental circumstances have been reported

              data, evidence for the influence of sleep discharge patterns on
              memory traces remains fragmentary. The underlying role of sleep
              in learning and memory has yet to be precisely characterized.",

  abstract = "A brain-computer interface (BCI) enables communication without
              movement based on brain signals measured with
              electroencephalography (EEG). BCIs usually rely on one of three
              types of signals: the P300 and other components of the
              event-related potential (ERP), steady state visual evoked
              potential (SSVEP), or event related desynchronization (ERD).
              Although P300 BCIs were introduced over twenty years ago, the
              past few years have seen a strong increase in P300 BCI research.
              This closed-loop BCI approach relies on the P300 and other
              components of the ERP, based on an oddball paradigm presented to
              the subject. In this paper, we overview the current status of
              P300 BCI technology, and then discuss new directions: paradigms
              for eliciting P300s; signal processing methods; applications; and
              hybrid BCIs. We conclude that P300 BCIs are quite promising, as
              several emerging directions have not yet been fully explored and
              could lead to improvements in bit rate, reliability, usability,

                   in making human-computer interaction more natural,

                   Among the existing solutions the systems relying on
                   electroencephalograms (EEG) occupy the most prominent place
                   due to their non-invasiveness. However, the process of
                   translating EEG signals into computer commands is far from
                   trivial, since it requires the optimization of many
                   different parameters that need to be tuned jointly. In this
                   report, we focus on the category of EEG-based BCIs that rely
                   on Steady-State-Visual-Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) and
                   perform a comparative evaluation of the most promising
                   algorithms existing in the literature. More specifically, we
                   define a set of algorithms for each of the various different
                   parameters composing a BCI system (i.e. filtering, artifact
                   removal, feature extraction, feature selection and
                   classification) and study each parameter independently by
                   keeping all other parameters fixed. The results obtained
                   from this evaluation process are provided together with a
                   dataset consisting of the 256-channel, EEG signals of 11
                   subjects, as well as a processing toolbox for reproducing
                   the results and supporting further experimentation. In this
                   way, we manage to make available for the community a
                   state-of-the-art baseline for SSVEP-based BCIs that can be
                   used as a basis for introducing novel methods and
